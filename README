Usage:

process_datfile.py GAMESS.DAT large_basis_name

where GAMESS.DAT = DAT file produced by GAMESS containing name of initial (small) basis set and MO coefficients in this basis set

Calls:

- basis.py to load up basis set details
- fit.py to reconstruct minimal basis atomic orbitals using basis functions from a larger basis set. 

Result: 

Small basis MOs expanded into / reconstructed using functions from larger basis set
