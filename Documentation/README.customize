To support new basis sets, a few simple steps are required:
- download basis set data from the EMSL basis set library
  (save as basisname.Gamess in basis set directory)
- make sure that each basis set specification is followed by
  a blank line (insert blank line after last basis set in file,
  before $END)
- add new basis name to basis_list in process_dat.py
